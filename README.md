## planet.opensuse.org

Planet openSUSE (http://planet.opensuse.org/) is a web feed aggregator that collects blog posts from people who contribute to openSUSE.

If you want to get your blog added, we prefer pull requests via github. 
* fork the repository
* edit *planetsuse/feeds*:
  * the URL to the RSS/Atom feed of your blog
  * in which language you blog, especially if it's not in English
  * your full name (e.g. John Doe)
  * your IRC nickname on Freenode, if you have any (e.g. jdoe)
  * whether you are an openSUSE Member so that a "member" button can be placed besides your name on the feedlist
  * a hackergotchi -- while it's not mandatory, it is a lot nicer for the readers. If you need help with this send a picture to the openSUSE Artwork team.
  * send a pull request once you are finished

Have a look at *planetsuse/config* if you want to know more about possible options. 

An alternative might be an Email to admin@opensuse.org - but you would not visit this side if you want to use this form, correct? ;-)
